This library contains native [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) components written from scratch in TypeScript using the [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) CSS framework.

**This release is a developer preview.** We are looking for community help to fix bugs, improve demo site and create new components.
